# yoda_forecast
A simple project to demo the usage of retrofit. Uses Mashape to make web requests

## Dependencies
This should make it easier for people to download the zip and run it immediately through their IDE, or from the command line without having to install *Maven/Gradle*

## For IDE users
Try importing the project

## For Other users
There is an *ant* build file setup. Try that!

## Project notes
The program does not terminate. It waits indefinitely for more output, to make it terminate normally, I have to use a **Condition** object, which is under **java.util.concurrent**. It makes the code slightly more complex, and I want to keep it simple here. (You can fill free to play around with it if you are interested!)
